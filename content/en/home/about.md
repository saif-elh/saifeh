Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Saif El Husseini. 

I am a recent Civil Engineering graduate at the University of Ottawa, and I studied abroad on a full scholarship at the University of Cambridge. I had the honour of winning both national and regional academic awards. I have interned both within Canada and overseas in engineering consultancy, engineering design and project management.


My interests are within the interdisciplinary work of engineering, psychology, technology, business and entrepreneurship. Currently, I am the founder of â€˜Reachout! Initiativeâ€™, a online national mental health resource bank providing Canadians resource assistance. 

Furthermore, I am the founder of 'Synapse Mind' an artificial intelligence, machine learning and pattern recognition application that helps mental health patients towards better lives. I had the honour of working on this personal project at the Business and Entrepreneurship program at Cambridge, England.

My goal is to be an advocate of change, educate others on the importance of mental health, and guide people towards a better life.
