Hi! My name is Saif El Husseini and I am a recent Civil Engineering graduate at the University of Ottawa, and I studied abroad on a full scholarship at the University of Cambridge. I have won both national and regional academic awards. I have interned both within Canada and overseas in engineering consultancy, engineering design and project management.


My interests are within the interdisciplinary work of engineering, psychology, technology, business and entrepreneurship. Currently, I am the founder of ‘Reachout! Initiative Canada’. This initiative is an online national mental health resource bank that provides Canadians cross-provincial resource assistance. 


My goal is to be an advocate of change whose mission is to educate others on the importance of mental health, and guide people toward a better life through resources, and workshops.
