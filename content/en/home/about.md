Hi! My name is Saif El Husseini and I am a UAE-born Palestinian-Canadian who’s passionate about the interdisciplinary of engineering, machine learning, psychology, and all things pertaining to business and entrepreneurship. I use agile principles and values to increase efficiencies for my team, clients, and organization.


I am a recent graduate in Civil Engineering at the University of Ottawa, and I studied abroad on a full scholarship at the University of Cambridge. I have won both national and regional academic awards. I have interned both within Canada and overseas in engineering consultancy, engineering design and project management.


I am the founder of ‘Reachout! Initiative Canada’. This initiative is an online national mental health resource bank that provides Canadians cross-provincial resource assistance. Currently, I am co-leading ‘Reachout! At Work’ and ‘Reachout! For Youth’ workshops to create change-makers within workspaces and academic institutions. My goal is to become a global mental health ambassador, whose mission is to educate others on the importance of mental health, and serve those who walk a difficult path by leading them to a better life.
